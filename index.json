	"content": "We consider the following setup.\n Suppose we have a set of time series. In general, the set can contain from one to a relatively large number of series (say, tens of thousands).\n For each time series we want to store actuals and to calculate and store forecasts. In particular, it is needed to store out-of-sample forecasts produced from different origins (rolling-origin forecasts) and with different horizons and, perhaps, using different methods. We also may want not only to store point forecasts, but prediction intervals (PIs), density forecasts, and additional information related to forecasting process (such as model coefficients, reasons for judgmental adjustments, etc.).\n We assume that both actuals and forecasts may be frequently updated as new data becomes available.\n  Given the above settings, we need to have a convenient means to store and access (and, perhaps, to distribute or exchange) forecasting data including actuals, forecasts, and the related information. We would like to find a means that would be fast, cross-platform, easy to learn and to implement.\nEventually, the storage of forecasting data is needed to perform adequate out-of-sample evaluation of forecasting accuracy. In the case of forecasting competitions, a well-defined approach to store forecasting data should enable a credible approach for forecasting accuracy comparisons.\nTo cite this website, please use the following reference:\nSai, C., Davydenko, A., \u0026amp; Shcherbakov, M.

	"content": "Forecast origin - The most recent historical period for which data is used to build a forecasting model. The next time period is the first forecast period.[2]\nForecast horizon -The number of periods from the forecast origin to the end of the time period being forecast.[1]\nPrediction intervals (PIs) – the bounds within which future observed values are expected to fall, given a specified level of confidence. For example, a 95% PI is expected to contain the actual forecast 95% of the time. Some researchers have found that estimated PIs are typically too narrow for quantitative and judgmental forecasting methods [1].\nOut-of-sample forecasts - the process using the model fitted on the sample (the data sample that you are using to fit the model) for forecasting for the new data points that was not part of the data sample. For example, if you use data 1990-2010 to fit the model and then you forecast for 2011-2013, it\u0026rsquo;s out-of-sample forecast (if you use 1990-2013 for fitting the model and then you forecast 2011-2013, then its in-sample forecast).(We used this discussion to develop this term)\nOut-of-sample evaluation - the process of formally evaluating the predictive capabilities of the models on the new data points not belonging to the training sample to see how effective the algorithms are in reproducing data.(We used this discussion to develop this term)\nRolling-origin forecast - This is a forecasting process in which the “origin” at which the forecast is based rolls forward in time.\nSlice and dice: To slice and dice is to break a body of information down into smaller parts or to examine it from different viewpoints so that you can understand it better [3].\nFramework - a conceptual structure intended to serve as a guide for the building of something that expands the structure into something useful [4].\nReferences:\n[1] J.

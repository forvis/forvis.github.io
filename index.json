	"content": "We consider the following setup.\n Suppose we have a set of time series. In general, the set can contain from one to a relatively large number of series (say, tens of thousands).\n For each time series we want to store actuals and to calculate and store forecasts. In particular, it is needed to store out-of-sample forecasts produced from different origins (rolling-origin forecasts) and with different horizons and, perhaps, using different methods. We also may want not only to store point forecasts, but prediction intervals (PIs), density forecasts, and additional information related to forecasting process (such as model coefficients, reasons for judgmental adjustments, etc.).\n We assume that both actuals and forecasts may be frequently updated as new data becomes available.\n  Given the above settings, we need to have a convenient means to store and access (and, perhaps, to distribute or exchange) forecasting data including actuals, forecasts, and the related information. We would like to find a means that would be fast, cross-platform, easy to learn and to implement.\nEventually, the storage of forecasting data is needed to perform adequate out-of-sample evaluation of forecasting accuracy. In the case of forecasting competitions, a well-defined approach to store forecasting data should enable a credible approach for forecasting accuracy comparisons.\nTo cite this website, please use the following reference:\nSai, C., Davydenko, A., \u0026amp; Shcherbakov, M.

E.g., having a forecast close to 350,000 units we had actual of only about 11,000 units. We also observe negative forecasts while actuals are always non-negative.\nLet’s take a closer look at the “really bad forecasts” spotted. With the AFTS format we can slice-and-dice forecast data in order to find the details:\nsubset(af, forecast \u0026gt; 100000) ## series_id category value timestamp method forecast horizon origin_timestamp ## 14862 Y113 MICRO 7475.00 1992 ARARMA 144595.0 4 1988 ## 14884 Y113 MICRO 11160.00 1993 ARARMA 224119.6 5 1988 ## 14906 Y113 MICRO 12505.00 1994 ARARMA 347381.2 6 1988 ## 43810 Y332 FINANCE 26099.16 1993 AutoBox1 112117.0 6 1987 ## 43814 Y332 FINANCE 26099.16 1993 ARARMA 102439.7 6 1987 ## 44030 Y334 FINANCE 30636.26 1991 AutoBox1 107644.4 4 1987 ## 44034 Y334 FINANCE 30636.26 1991 ARARMA 111450.1 4 1987 ## 44052 Y334 FINANCE 35104.84 1992 AutoBox1 140253.9 5 1987 ## 44056 Y334 FINANCE 35104.84 1992 ARARMA 144957.9 5 1987 ## 44073 Y334 FINANCE 45525.66 1993 B-J auto 103875.3 6 1987 ## 44074 Y334 FINANCE 45525.66 1993 AutoBox1 182804.6 6 1987 ## 44078 Y334 FINANCE 45525.66 1993 ARARMA 188824.7 6 1987  For series_id=’Y113’ one of the actuals is 7475.00, while the corresponding forecast is 144595.0 \u0026ndash; a huge forecast error. Let’s show this forecast on the graph.\nFirst, in order visualization tools to work correctly, we must prepare appropriate time-based object timestamp columns for the data_ts and data_fs:\nlibrary(zoo) data_ts$timestamp_dbo \u0026lt;- as.yearmon(data_ts$timestamp, format = \u0026#39;%Y\u0026#39;) data_fs$timestamp_dbo \u0026lt;- as.yearmon(data_fs$timestamp, format = \u0026#39;%Y\u0026#39;) Then we can show forecasts produced at origin=1988 using a set of methods (say, \u0026ldquo;ARARMA\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;HOLT\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;NAIVE2\u0026rdquo;) using the fixed origin graph:\nplotFixedOrigin(ts = data_ts, fs = data_fs, id = \u0026#34;Y113\u0026#34;, origin = 1988, m = c(\u0026#34;ARARMA\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;HOLT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;NAIVE2\u0026#34;)) Methods “ARARMA” and “Autobox1” are performing quite badly since they tend to extrapolate trends that do not hold in subsequent periods. Thus, the prediction-realization diagram together with the fixed origin graph helped identify the risks associated with using some methods like “ARARMA”. However, it’s just how the forecast methods works like, so there are no unexpected cases here.\nWhen working with interval predictions, we may want to visualize the forecast uncertainty using the fan chart.\n# load quarterly M3-data # load time series actuals data_ts \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forvis/forvision_data/master/M3_quarterly_TSTS.csv\u0026#34;) # load forecasts data_fs \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forvis/forvision_data/master/M3_quarterly_FTS.csv\u0026#34;) # prepare appropriate time-based object timestamp columns for the data_ts and data_fs library(zoo) data_ts$timestamp_dbo \u0026lt;- as.yearqtr(ts$timestamp, format = \u0026#39;%Y-Q%q\u0026#39;) data_fs$timestamp_dbo \u0026lt;- as.yearqtr(fs$timestamp, \u0026#39;%Y-Q%q\u0026#39;) # plot a fan chart plotFanChart(ts = data_ts, fs = data_fs, id =\u0026#34;Q1\u0026#34;, origin = \u0026#34;1992-Q4\u0026#34;, m = \u0026#34;ARIMA\u0026#34;) After visual exploration of the input data and confirming that it is of appropriate quality, we can proceed to applying formal techniques to measure forecasting performance and compare alternative forecasting techniques.\n"

	"content": "Forecast origin – the most recent historical period for which data is used to build a forecasting model. The next time period is the first forecast period [2].\nForecast horizon – the number of periods from the forecast origin to the end of the time period being forecast [1].\nPrediction intervals (PIs) – the bounds within which future observed values are expected to fall, given a specified level of confidence. For example, a 95% PI is expected to contain the actual forecast 95% of the time. Some researchers have found that estimated PIs are typically too narrow for quantitative and judgmental forecasting methods [1].\nOut-of-sample forecasts – the process using the model fitted on the sample (the data sample that you are using to fit the model) for forecasting for the new data points that was not part of the data sample. For example, if you use data 1990-2010 to fit the model and then you forecast for 2011-2013, it\u0026rsquo;s out-of-sample forecast (if you use 1990-2013 for fitting the model and then you forecast 2011-2013, then its in-sample forecast). We used this discussion to develop this term.\nOut-of-sample evaluation – the process of formally evaluating the predictive capabilities of the models on the new data points not belonging to the training sample to see how effective the algorithms are in reproducing data. We used this discussion to develop this term.\nRolling-origin forecast – this is a forecasting process in which the “origin” at which the forecast is based rolls forward in time [5].\nSlice and dice – to slice and dice is to break a body of information down into smaller parts or to examine it from different viewpoints so that you can understand it better [3].\nFramework – a conceptual structure intended to serve as a guide for the building of something that expands the structure into something useful [4].\nReferences:\n[1] J.

	"content": "In the Forvision project   we focus on the issues of the implementation of software elements for forecasting performance evaluation and visualization.\nIn particular, we focus on the following two interrelated tasks:\n To define simple yet flexible enough data structures in order to store all the information needed for forecasts evaluation (assuming the settings and requirements described here)\n To develop a reliable methodology (including a set of appropriate tools) for forecasts exploratory analysis and accuracy evaluation based on the data structures defined.\n  Our current results involve:\n A set of data schemas, a data flow chart, and a set of corresponding graphical tools and metrics for the typical analysis of forecasting performance: Our recommended approach to handling data for forecasting performance evaluation is presented in this diagram\n A more flexible data schema for storing forecasting results for the case where we need to store not only point or interval forecasts, but, for example, density forecasts, model parameters, etc.\n  Our preliminary results have been presented here:\nSai, C., Davydenko, A., \u0026amp; Shcherbakov, M.
